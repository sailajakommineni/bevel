# Docs
## About
This directory contains the files required to create open-source documentation.
Tools used: [Sphinx] (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
### Configuration files
* **Index.rst** - This is the main document. The main function of this document is to serve as a welcome page and to contain the root of the “table of contents tree” (or toctree). This is one of the main things that Sphinx adds to reStructuredText: a way to connect multiple files to a single hierarchy of documents.
* **conf.py**: The configuration directory must contain a file named conf.py. This file (containing Python code) is called the “build configuration file” and contains (almost) all the configuration needed to customize Sphinx input and output behavior.
* **.md files**: Create all the markdown files that are referenced in the document tree with the appropriate content.
